    This function processes content that may be a string, a list of mixed text and image URLs, or None,
    and converts it into a string. Text is directly appended to the result string, while image URLs are
    represented by a placeholder image token. If the content is None, an empty string is returned.

    Args:
        - content (Union[str, List, None]): The content to be processed. Can be a string, a list of dictionaries
                                      representing text and image URLs, or None.

    Returns:
        str: A string representation of the input content. Image URLs are replaced with an image token.

    Note:
    - The function expects each dictionary in the list to have a "type" key that is either "text" or "image_url".
      For "text" type, the "text" key's value is appended to the result. For "image_url", an image token is appended.
    - This function is useful for handling content that may include both text and image references, especially
      in contexts where images need to be represented as placeholders.
